# Python Tools

## About

Some tools build with Python. All of the tools are build **for myself**. I will try to give more introduction at README but **I won't give you help**. If you faced problems about how to using these tools, please don't post any issue because it's no use and I will give no help and just close your issue.

If you want to use my code, just do what the fu*k you want to. If you want, give a link to this repository.
